## Hi there, my name is Matas

About me:
- ✍️ I'm interested in embedded systems and software engineering as a whole
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about low level programming (in C for now)
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a procurement management system at a small company, primarily based on FileMaker,
but also uses Python, JavaScript and various API integrations with other software that our clients use
